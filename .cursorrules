## Initial Assessment
- Verify the ERC follows the standard template format
- Check if the ERC number has been properly assigned
- Confirm the ERC status is marked as "Draft"
- Ensure all required sections are present (Abstract, Motivation, Specification, Rationale, Security Considerations)

## Technical Review

### Specification Quality
- Validate that the technical specification is complete and unambiguous
- Verify all technical terms are clearly defined
- Check that the specification uses "MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY" keywords appropriately per RFC 2119
- Ensure code examples (if any) are correct and follow Solidity style guidelines

### Compatibility & Dependencies
- Assess backward compatibility implications
- Review dependencies on other ERCs or Ethereum standards
- Verify compliance with referenced ERCs and specifications
- Check for potential conflicts with existing standards

### Security Analysis
- Review security considerations section thoroughly
- Look for potential attack vectors or vulnerabilities
- Verify threat model assumptions
- Check gas considerations and potential DoS vectors

## Community & Process

### Discussion Quality
- Verify sufficient discussion has occurred on ethereum-magicians.org
- Check for duplicate or similar existing ERCs
- Review community feedback and author responses
- Assess if major objections have been addressed

### Implementation
- Check if reference implementation exists (if required)
- Verify test cases are provided
- Review any real-world implementation examples
- Assess deployment considerations

## Final Checklist
1. All sections are technically accurate and complete
2. No ambiguities in specification
3. Security considerations are comprehensive
4. Community feedback has been adequately addressed
5. Implementation details are sufficient
6. Document is well-written and professionally formatted

## Feedback Process
- Provide clear, actionable feedback
- Reference specific sections when commenting
- Suggest concrete improvements
- Be constructive and professional
- Include both technical and editorial feedback

Remember: The goal is to improve the quality of the ERC while maintaining a constructive dialogue with the author(s).
