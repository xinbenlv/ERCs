# ERC Review Guidelines

This rule helps reviewers ensure ERC proposals meet community expectations and quality standards.

## General Requirements

- **EIP Formatting Compliance**: Ensure proposals follow the [EIP template](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-template.md), including Abstract, Motivation, Specification, Rationale, and Backwards Compatibility.

- **Clarity and Precision**: Proposals must be clear, free of ambiguity, and technically sound.

- **Security Considerations**: Authors must address any potential risks or security impacts in the "Security Considerations" section.

- **Backward Compatibility**: Evaluate whether the proposal introduces breaking changes or incompatibilities.

## Implementation Expectations

- **Reference Implementation Required**: Authors **must include at least one working reference implementation** to advance an ERC to Review status.

- **Independent Implementations for Final**: To progress to Final status, ERCs **should demonstrate adoption with at least two or three independent implementations**, depending on category (as proposed in your straw-man model).

- **Real-World Usage Evidence**: Encourage proposals to be "tried in the field"—for example, integration in dapps, libraries, or tooling—to help reveal practical issues.

## Review & Consensus

- **Community Engagement**: Ensure authors have engaged in public discussion, ideally via Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (FEM) or similar forums.

- **Sufficient Feedback**: Check whether proposals have incorporated feedback from multiple stakeholders.

- **Consensus Signals**: Help authors understand that advancing to Final may require signs of broad adoption or support, even if not formally quantified.

## Editor Feedback Suggestions

Encourage authors to:
- Provide implementation links or GitHub repositories.
- Share usage data or testimonials from adopters.
- Clearly explain how their proposal aligns with or diverges from similar EIPs.
- Discuss how feedback from the community has been addressed.
